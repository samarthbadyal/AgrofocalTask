# AgrofocalTask

Within this repository, there are 2 files: agrofocal.py and audioAgrofocal.py.

agrofocal.py is the main file for this project. This file has a function, called agrofocal, that takes 2 input parameters: fileName and newFile. This first parameter, fileName, should be the location of a video file within your machine. For example, "/Users/samarthbadyal/Downloads/IMG_0532.mov". When called upon, this function reads the input video file, downisizes the resolution to 720p, and puts the video in reverse order. This function will create a new .MOV video with all of these features as an output. The second parameter, newFile, will be the location/name of this new video on your machine.


The other file in this repository, audioAgrofocal.py is an unfinished version of agrofocal.py. This file has all of the same features as the main file, but I am working on it to be able to add and reverse the original audio from the input video. The project specifications did not include anything about audio, but this file will soon be able to deal with the audio element as well. However, it is not functional yet and will not run.
